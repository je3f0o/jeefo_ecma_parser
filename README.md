# Story
Long time ago when I was trying to learn create my own Game Engine in C++ I had 
a problem. I wanted to implement some scripting language in my Game Engine and I 
didn't know how programming languages are works. Later when I was learning 
Javascript I found a video Douglas crockford talking about how to create a
Javascript Linter and another video Douglas crockford talking about Syntaxation 
in GOTO Conferences. So that motivated me to create my own Javascript parser. 
Then I read ECMAScript specs and created this parser in 2-3 months in 1 summer.
Since then I understood javascript very deeply...
